I dont know why i miss a sentence about all angular repos :'(. Anyway i made an app to checks leaderboard for most popularity contributors from
angular repository. U can look at his/her profile, at his follwers etc. U have to log in with github, this is important to access api. If there is problem
with a task i can make another one with all angular repositories. This isnt problem. Atm im so mad at myself :( Cheers
